# Personal Portfolio

This is the repository of my personal portfolio. I've designed it to have a retro yet modern look, featuring distinctive light and dark themes.
The /projects page showcases a list of my personal web developments. You can click on any project tag to access more information.
I've added a button to toggle text justification on the web. Justified text can be divisive, so this feature allows for an easier reading experience.
