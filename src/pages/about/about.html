        <sapn class="drop-cap">W</sapn>elcome! My name is Adrian, a future Full-Stack maestro with a current focus on
        front-end, and a
        dedicated Software Engineering student.

      <p>A perfectionist who believes details truly matter. I believe great development is about more than just writing
        code. It's about understanding the end user, empathizing with their needs, and anticipating how they'll interact
        with the final product.</p>

      <h4>How it all started?</h4>
      <div class="multi-column">
        <p>It all started back in high school during an IT class. Our mission? Build a video game using Python. I was
          instantly hooked. Classes were slow, so I went solo, learning the ropes from YouTube tutorials. Before long, I
          knew what I wanted: a Pac-Man clone. Pretty tough for a beginner, but I wasn't fazed. The end result wasn't
          perfect, but it was a great learning experience.</p>

      <h4>My next stage</h4>
      <div class="multi-column">
        <p>Subsequently, I ventured into college, pursuing a degree in Software Engineering (currently in my third
          year). Somewhere along this path, I joined forces with a team called Uvigo MotorSport—an exclusive Galician
          Formula Student team—eager to embrace a fresh experience. Yet, my time there was brief, as it didn't ignite my
          true passion.</p>

          <p>Soon thereafter, a new revelation dawned—I stumbled upon the world of web development. The decision was
            clear: I enrolled in a bootcamp to expedite my mastery and secure a tangible certification. Today, I find
            myself midway through the program, brimming with anticipation to conclude and embark on a journey into the
            professional realm.</p>

        <h5>Frustrated designer runs amok with Captcha ideas</h5>
        <p>From Tic Tac Toe to solving meme-based questions, this is a different take on how web captchas
          should be. "I have not successfully picked out all photos of a truck on the first try.
          Something's gotta change," says the designer, who has requested to remain anonymous.</p>

        <h5>Slack UI gets reverse engineered</h5>
        <p>Another valiant effort to reverse engineer a web app. However, the UI is repurposed to showcase
          Codepens instead of mock conversations. This is a codepen showcase inception situation.</p>
