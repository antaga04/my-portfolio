  "p1": "It all started back in high school during an IT class. Our mission? Build a video game using Python. I was instantly hooked. But classes were slow, so I decided to learn on my own online. Before long, I knew what I wanted: a Pac-Man clone. Pretty tough for a beginner, but I was determined. The end result wasn't perfect, but it was a great learning experience.",
  "p2": "Subsequently, I ventured into college, pursuing a degree in Software Engineering (currently in my third year). Somewhere along this path, I joined forces with a team called Uvigo MotorSportâ€”an exclusive Galician Formula Student team; eager to embrace a fresh experience. Yet, my time there was brief, as it didn't ignite my true passion.",
  "p3": "Soon thereafter, a new revelation dawned; I stumbled upon the world of web development. The decision was clear: I enrolled in a bootcamp to expedite my mastery and secure a tangible certification. Today, I find myself almost midway through the program, brimming with anticipation to conclude and embark on a journey into the professional realm.",
